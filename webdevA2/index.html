                                From royal residences to rock shows, the piano has continued to be one of the most potent and expressive instruments throughout history. Created by Bartolomeo Cristofori circa 1700, it was the first keyboard capable of producing both soft and loud sounds—transforming music. 
                                Legends such as Mozart and Beethoven transformed it into an expressive medium of narrative and intensity. With the advancement of technology, the piano transformed—from grand performance venues to contemporary synthesizers.
                                Despite the passage of time, it perseveres as the "king of instruments," linking emotion to melody.

                                        The Piano evovled from other instuments such as the hapsicord and clavichold. Around 1700, Bartolomeo Cristofori was employed by
                                        The Grand Prince of Tuscany as the Keeper of Instruments. His knowledge of the workings of hapsicords and keyboard instruments helped
                                        Cristofori invent the first ever Pianos in history. Although we do not know when Cristofori first created the Piano, 3 original Cristofori pianos survive
                                        today dated from the 1720s

                                        Cristofori called the piano: "gravicembalo col piano e forte", meaning "harpsichord with soft and loud." as it was the first keyboard instrument that could change
                                        its volume based on how hard it was played.

                                        During the 1900s the piano was still on its peak in history, still being one of the most well known instruments in history. Eventually the modern Grand Piano was completed and much later on the Electric piano was created. The piano started to grow in popularity outside of the west and started spreading its influence into the east starting with Japan during the Meji era
                                        . Eventually in the 1920s, the piano replaced the Koto as the preffered instrument for Japanese women to learn before marriage as the piano became a symbol of domestic modernity.
